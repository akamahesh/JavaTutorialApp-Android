    <dd>
        The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java bydefault. In other words,
        it is the topmost class of java.

        The Object class is beneficial if you want to refer any object whose type you don't know.
        Notice that parent class reference variable can refer the child class object, know as
        upcasting.

        Let's take an example, there is getObject() method that returns an object but it can be of
        any type like Employee,Student etc, we can use Object class reference to refer that object.
        For example:


    </dd>
    <dt class="text-danger">Object obj=getObject();//we don't what object would be returned from
        this method
    </dt>
</dl>
