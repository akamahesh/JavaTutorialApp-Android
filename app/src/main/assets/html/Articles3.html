    <dt class="text-danger"> Java Static keyword</dt>
    <dd>
        The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply java static
        keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested class. The static keyword belongs to the
        class than instance of the class.

        The static can be:

        1.variable (also known as class variable)
        2.method (also known as class method)
        3.block
        4.nested class

    </dd>
    <dt class="text-danger">1) Java static variable</dt>
    <dd>
        <b>If you declare any variable as static, it is known static variable.</b>

       -> The static variable can be used to refer the common property of all objects
        (that is not unique for each object) e.g. company name of employees,college name of students etc.
        ->The static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.

    </dd>

    <dt class="text-danger">2) Java static method</dt>
    <dd>
       <b> If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.</b>

        ->A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
        ->A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
        ->static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

    </dd>

    <dt class="text-danger">3) Java static block</dt>
    <dd>
        ->Is used to initialize the static data member.
        ->It is executed before main method at the time of classloading.

    </dd>
